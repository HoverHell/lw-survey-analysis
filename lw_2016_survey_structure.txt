SL		surveyls_title		LessWrong Diaspora 2016 Survey		en																																																																																																																										
SL		surveyls_welcometext		<p>   This is the 2016 LessWrong Diaspora Survey. The last survey was conducted in late 2014. In the last two years or so most of the community has moved away from LessWrong proper into 'diaspora' communities on a wide variety of websites and chatrooms. Because of this we've decided to expand the scope of who our survey targets to explicitly include the entire LessWrong community on site and off.</p>  <p>   The largest motivation for running this years survey is to gauge where the community is at and what various factions would want from a successor community to the original LessWrong. <a href="http://lesswrong.com/user/Elo">Elo</a> is currently coordinating <a href="http://lesswrong.com/user/vaniver">Vaniver's</a> <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/n0l/lesswrong_20/">LessWrong 2.0</a> project and this survey is intended to help him and other efforts which should be coming soon. If you would like to be put on a mailing list to hear more (we will not spam you and we will not give your email address to a third party) you can give us your email address for this purpose at the end of the survey.</p>  <p>   <strong><span style="font-size:36px;">You may skip any question you don't want to answer. Some questions are explicitly marked 'bonus' or 'optional' meaning they are especially skippable without significantly impacting your overall survey results. </span></strong></p>  <p>    </p>  <p>   <strong><span style="font-size:36px;">If you find yourself fatigued by the length of the survey feel free to take a break and come back, or skip every question and move straight to the end to turn in what you have.</span></strong></p>  <p>    </p>  <p>   <strong><span style="font-size:36px;">Happy Surveying!</span></strong></p>  		en

A	0	1		Non-cognitivism: Moral statements don't  express propositions and can neither be true nor false. "Murder is  wrong" means something like "Boo murder!".		en																																																																																																																										
A	0	2		Error theory: Moral statements have a  truth-value, but attempt to describe features of the world that don't  exist. "Murder is wrong" and "Murder is right" are both false statements  because moral rightness and wrongness aren't features that exist.		en																																																																																																																										
A	0	3		Subjectivism: Some moral statements are  true, but not universally, and the truth of a moral statement is  determined by non-universal opinions or prescriptions, and there is no  non-attitudinal determinant of rightness and wrongness. "Murder is  wrong" means something like "My culture has judged murder to be wrong"  or "I've judged murder to be wrong".		en																																																																																																																										
A	0	4		Substantive realism: Some moral statements  are true, and the truth of a moral statement is determined by  mind-independent moral properties. "Murder is wrong" means that murder  has an objective mind-independent property of wrongness that we discover  by empirical investigation, intuition, or some other method.		en																																																																																																																										
A	0	5		Constructivism: Some moral statements are  true, and the truth of a moral statement is determined by whether an  agent would accept it if they were undergoing a process of rational  deliberation. "Murder is wrong" can mean something like "Societal  agreement to the rule 'do not murder' is instrumentally rational".		en

G	G18	Calibration Questions	1	"Calibration" is the practice of knowing how certain you are, even when  you're not certain. For example, a bookie who says they're 90% certain  of the outcome of each of a hundred horse races, and who is right about  ninety out of those hundred horse races - is perfectly calibrated.  In these questions, you will be asked a question and then asked to give a  calibration percent. The percent represents your probability that the  answer is right. Suppose the question is "What country is the city of  Paris located in?" and you are absolutely sure it is France. In that  case, your calibration percent is 100 - you are 100% sure it is France.  But suppose you think there's a fifty-fifty chance it's either France or  Germany. In that case, you might still answer France, but your  calibration percent is only 50 - you are only 50% sure it's France. Or  suppose you have no idea, so you pick a country totally at random. In  that case, you might think that if there are about one hundred possible  countries, and it could be any of them, there's only about a 1% chance  you're right. Therefore, you would put down a calibration percent of 1. Please answer on a scale from 0% (definitely false) to 100% (definitely true). Do not include the percent sign in your answer. For your convenience, 0% will be interpreted as "epsilon" and 100% as "100 minus epsilon". Do **NOT** give your answer in the form of a decimal between 0 and 1 unless you deliberately mean for it to be interpreted as a very small percent. For example, 0.5 will be interpreted as 0.5%, that is, a one in two hundred chance,**NOT** as 50%. Wikipedia will be considered the authoritative source (where applicable) in case of any dispute as to the answers of these questions.		en
